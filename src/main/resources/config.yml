radio:
  # Display name of the radio item (supports MiniMessage and legacy color codes)
  display-name: "&#f57542Radio"

  # Description text shown when hovering over the radio item
  # Supports MiniMessage and legacy color codes
  lore: "&fA radio that lets you communicate over distances"

  craft:
    # Whether players can craft the radio item
    enabled: true

    # Crafting recipe in 3x3 grid format
    # Each line represents a row (top, middle, bottom)
    # Use comma-separated Minecraft material names
    # Use "air" for no item in that slot

radio-block:
  # How far (in blocks) the radio searches for nearby input radios
  # When a player speaks, the plugin looks for input radios within this radius
  input_search_radius: 15

  # Maximum distance (in blocks) at which radio blocks are visible to players
  # Radio blocks beyond this distance won't render for players
  # Higher values may cause FPS drops for players with many radios nearby
  view_range: 64

  # Maximum frequency number that can be set on radios
  # Players can set frequencies from 1 to this number
  max_frequency: 15

  # Maximum number of radio blocks allowed per chunk
  # Prevents lag from too many radios in one area
  blocks_per_chunk_limit: 10

  # How far (in blocks) players can hear audio from output radios
  # Voice transmitted through radios can be heard within this distance
  output_radius: 15

  # If true, radio frequency is controlled by redstone signal strength (0-15)
  # If false, players can manually change frequencies by shift-clicking
  redstone_frequency: false

  # If true, output radios emit redstone signal (1-15) based on distance from input (BETA!!!, may be unstable)
  # If false, radios will still transmit audio but without redstone signal output
  signal_output_system: false

  # If true, enables integration with CustomDiscsSVC plugin
  # When enabled, music discs played in jukeboxes below radio blocks will be broadcast
  # When disabled, the CustomDiscs bridge functionality is completely turned off
  custom_discs_integration: true

skin:
  # MineSkin API key for uploading custom radio block textures
  # Get your free API key at: https://account.mineskin.org/keys/
  # If left empty or invalid, the plugin will use default textures
  api_key: TOKEN_TOKEN_TOKEN

audio-effects:
  # Enable/disable radio audio effects (bandpass filter and noise)
  enabled: true

  # Apply audio effects to CustomDiscs broadcasts
  # If false, custom discs will bypass audio processing (recommended for stability)
  apply_to_custom_discs: false

  # Center frequency for the bandpass filter (Hz)
  # Controls the main frequency that passes through clearly
  center_frequency: 750.0

  # Bandwidth of the filter (Hz)
  # Wider bandwidth = more frequencies pass through (clearer sound)
  bandwidth: 4000.0

  # Audio degradation severity (0.0 - 1.0)
  # Higher values = more static/noise and narrower frequency range
  severity: 0.05
